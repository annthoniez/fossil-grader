This directory keeps various data for testing the grader.

File listing
------------
- ev              : tasks for testing
  - add           : read 2 integers and return result (timelimit = 1)
- submissions     : sourcecode for testing
  - add
    - add.c       : correct implementation in C
    - addcpp.cpp  : correct implementation in C++
    - addloop.c   : code that loop, to test time out
    - addcra.cpp  : code that crashes.   (TODO)


How to test the grader
----------------------
1. Set up the submission web.
2. Add the tasks and copy ev dir of that task to the real ev directory.
3. Build scomp.exe from ../src/comparators and copy to real ev directory.
3. Try submitting various source codes and see results.


How to test _only_ the execution lib for grader
----------------------------------------------- 
If you only want to make sure that the execution library works fine,
you can just use a batch file test_witn_trun.bat to do that, using the
following steps.

1. Compile trun.exe. (it is also included in the make file)
2. Copy trun.exe to bin dir (i.e., bin\trun.exe)
3. Run test_witn_trun.bat in test dir.  It will create a new file
called test_witn_trun.local.bat.   
4. Edit that file.  Provide correct option TCCOPT for tcc 
(e.g., -Ic:\tc -Lc:\tc -ml).
5. Run test_witn_trun.local.bat
