How to install
==============

You can use the binary grader.exe.  If you want to change it youself, see how to compile grader.exe below.

1. Get the web submission working first.
2. Edit grader.conf (see example from grader.conf.SAMPLE)
   - Add database config
   - Check command line for compilation, especially on paths
3. Edit test data (by default they are in ev/, see example in ev/add)
4. Make sure you set paths correctly.
   - Make sure you have libmysql.dll on the path, or you can just copy it from mysql dir to grader's dir.
   - If you want to use Turbo C, make sure tlink.exe is on the path.
   - To change path settings, go to Settings -> Control Panel -> System -> Advanced -> Environment Variables
     Then add the required paths in PATH variable.  
     For example, if you want to add Turbo C bin path, you can put "C:\TC\BIN;" in front of all other paths,
     if your Turbo C executables, e.g., tcc.exe and tlink.exe are in C:\TC\BIN.     
5. Start grader by calling grader.exe

If you make any changes on the config, don't forget to restart the grader.  (Restart it using the usual way: Ctrl-C.)
