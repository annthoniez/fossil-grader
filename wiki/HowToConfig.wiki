== How to add users ==

Each user has *user_id* and *password* (for logging in), *name* (can be full name).  A user can also belongs to a *group*.

There are 3 types of users: administrator (*A*), group supervisor (*S*), and contestant (*C*).  An admin can generate passwords, view score reports, add a list of new users, and view their passwords (so that the passwords can be distributed to users in competition).  A group supervisor can view the scores of all contestants in the group.  To specify user's type, we use `A`, `S`, or `C`.

=== How to add individual users ===

To add an individual user, you have to do it directly on the database.  Just insert a row to table `user_info`.  The following shows the structure of `user_info` table:

{{{
TABLE: user_info 
COLUMNS:
  user_id  varchar(10)  -- username
  name     varchar(100) -- full name
  passwd   varchar(10)  -- password (not encrypted)
  grp      varchar(10)  -- group id
  type     char(1)      -- user type:
                          'C' for contestant
                          'S' for supervisor
                          'A' for admin
}}}

=== How to add bulk of users ==

If you log in as an admin, you can see a menu *upload student info*.  That's the link for adding users.  Prepare a text file that contains users' information, one line per each user, in the following format:

  `username:name:password:type:group`

Note that we use `:` as a field separator.
